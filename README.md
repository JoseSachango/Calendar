# Calendar-App

## Description

Calendar-App is simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. It runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## Usage 

when you open the calendar you can find the current date listed at the very top at the end of the header. As you scroll down you are present with time blocks corresponding to a given hour in the working day. The time blocks can be either red, grey, or green. red corresponds to the current time, green corresponds to future events and grey corresponds to events that have passed. You can input events into the textboxs and save those events by clicking the blue button on the right hand side of the page that says save. Those evebts will persist after refreshing the page. To remove saved events simply delete the content in the event box and click the blue save button again.
